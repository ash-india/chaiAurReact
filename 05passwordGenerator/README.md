Initial Render:

When the page first loads, useEffect is triggered, which, in turn, calls passwordGenerator.
passwordGenerator generates a password based on the specified criteria and updates the password state.
Re-render on State Change:

When there are changes in the dependencies (length, numberAllowed, charAllowed) of useEffect, it re-triggers.
On re-triggering, passwordGenerator is called again.
useCallback ensures that if the dependencies have changed, a new function is memoized. In your case, a new passwordGenerator function is created because the length has changed, or one of the other dependencies has changed.
Memoization and Dependency Check:

The useEffect memoizes the previous passwordGenerator function.
When the dependencies change, it checks whether the previous passwordGenerator function is still valid. If not, it recreates the function.
This ensures that passwordGenerator is created only when its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
Purpose of useCallback:

The purpose of using useCallback here is to optimize performance by memoizing the function. Without it, a new function would be created on every render, potentially leading to unnecessary re-renders.
setPassword in Dependencies:

Including setPassword in the dependencies array ensures that the latest version of setPassword is used inside the passwordGenerator function, preventing stale closures.


```Javascript
  const passwordGenerator = ()=>{
    let pass = "";
    let str = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

    if(numberAllowed) str += "0123456789";
    if(charAllowed) str += "!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}`~?/.,<>"

    for(let i=1;i<=length;i++){
      let char = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length );
      pass += str.charAt(char);
    }
    setPassword(pass);
  }

  useEffect(()=>{
    passwordGenerator();
  },[length,numberAllowed,charAllowed]);
```

The abve code is also working

`The decision to use useCallback depends on whether you need to memoize the function to optimize performance.`


passwordGenerator Function:
passwordGenerator is a simple function that generates a password based on the specified criteria and updates the password state.

useEffect:
useEffect is utilized to call passwordGenerator when there are changes in the dependencies (length, numberAllowed, charAllowed).
This ensures that the password is generated and updated whenever any of these dependencies change.

Input Controls:
The input controls (range input and checkboxes) are used to control the criteria for password generation (length, numberAllowed, charAllowed).



A stale closure occurs when a function, which has access to variables from its outer scope, is defined, and then that function is used in a different context where the values of those outer variables have changed. However, the function still refers to the old (stale) values of those variables.

In React, stale closures often come up when dealing with asynchronous operations, event handlers, or callbacks that capture the state or props of a component at the time of their creation. If the component re-renders and the function is not updated, it might refer to outdated values.

## useRef

useRef in React is a hook that provides a mutable object, current, which can hold a mutable value. Unlike state variables managed by useState, changes to the current property of a useRef object do not trigger a re-render. This makes it useful for holding values that need to persist across renders without causing the component to re-render.
